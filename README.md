# Applied Cryptography From the University of Tartu

A self-paced learning journey into applied cryptography from Tartu. Here is some background about [UOT](https://ut.ee/en).

The course is very project-intensive and intended to equip learners with theoretical and practical knowledge. The professor gives a sample `code structure` and a professional, detailed overview of every project.

You can find more details about the course from the playlist link below. Also, I'll update the README doc for any project I complete. (Watch out!!!)

## Projects Completed

- One-time pad (OTP)
  - OTP is a cryptosystem that is unbreakable and impractical at the same time. The crypto needs a new key with key length = plaintext length for every encryption. [More details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad)
