# Applied Cryptography From the University of Tartu

A self-paced learning journey into applied cryptography from Tartu. Here is some background about [UOT](https://ut.ee/en).

The course is very project-intensive and intended to equip learners with theoretical and practical knowledge. The professor gives a sample `code structure` and a professional, detailed overview of every project.

You can find more details about the course from the playlist link below. Also, I'll update the README doc for any project I complete. (Watch out!!!)

## Projects Completed

<<<<<<< HEAD
- One-time-pad (OTP)

  - OTP is a cryptosystem that is unbreakable, and impractical at the sametime. The crypto needs a a new key with keylength = plaintext length for every encryption. [More details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad)

- Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN1)

  - The task is to implement ASN.1 DER (Distinguished Encoding Rule) encoder that can encode subset of ASN.1 types by implementing these function: `asn1_boolean(boolean)`, `asn1_integer(i)`... (I have completed the boolean function which now returns an encoded output).
