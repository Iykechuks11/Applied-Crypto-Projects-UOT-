# Applied Cryptography From University of Tartu

A self-paces learning journey into appliec cryptography from Tartu. Some background about [UOT](https://ut.ee/en).

The course is very project intensive, and is intented to equip learners with both theoritical and practical knowledge. The Professor gives a sample `code structure`, and a professional detialed overview of every project.

You can find more details about the course from the playlist link below. Additionally, for any project I complete, I will update the readme doc.

## Projects Completed

- One-time-pad (OTP)

  - OTP is a cryptosystem that is unbreakable, and impractical at the sametime. The crypto needs a a new key with keylength = plaintext length for every encryption. [More details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad)

- Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN1)

  - The task is to implement ASN.1 DER (Distinguished Encoding Rule) encoder that can encode subset of ASN.1 types by implementing these function: `asn1_boolean(boolean)`, `asn1_integer(i)`... (I have completed the boolean function which now returns an encoded output).
